 ### Bootstrap is an open-source framework used for developing and designing user interfaces (UI) quickly and efficiently. It is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a collection of pre-designed tools and components such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars, which makes building responsive websites and web applications easier. Bootstrap also includes interactive elements like dropdowns, carousels, and alerts, making it a popular choice among web developers for speeding up UI development while ensuring compatibility across different devices.
